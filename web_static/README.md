The web static part of this project is written to give an understanding of HTML and CSS and how to construct a web site for th client side.
Before developing a big and complex web application, we will build the front end step-by-step.

The first step is to “design” / “sketch” / “prototype” each element:

- Create simple HTML static pages
- Style guide
- Fake contents
- No Javascript
- No data loaded from anything
